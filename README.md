# Project Animal Kingdom Search

A student that completes this project shows that they can:

* Use and implement abstract classes
* Use and implement Lambda Expressions

## Introduction

Using a combination of abstract classes and lambda expressions, students will create and manipulate a list of animals using object oriented design principles.

## Instruction

* [ ] Create an abstract class for animals
  * [ ] All animals consume food the same way
  * [ ] Each animal is assigned a unique number, a name, and year discovered regardless of classification.

- [ ] Methods will return a string saying how that animal implements the action
  - [ ] All animals can move, breath, reproduce. How they do that, so what string should get returned when the method is executed, varies by animal type.

* [ ] Create classes for mammals, birds, fish
  * [ ] Mammals move - walk, breath - lungs, reproduce - live births
  * [ ] Birds move - fly, breath - lungs, reproduce - eggs
  * [ ] Fish move - swim, breath - gills, reproduce - eggs

Hint: think about abstract classes and creating an ArrayList using an abstract class type.

Create a collection for the animals using the following data

* [ ] **Mammals:**

    | Name      | Year Named |
    |-----------|-------|
    | Panda     | 1869  |
    | Zebra     | 1778  |
    | Koala     | 1816  |
    | Sloth     | 1804  |
    | Armadillo | 1758  |
    | Raccoon   | 1758  |
    | Bigfoot   | 2021  |

* [ ] **Birds:**

    | Name      | Year Named |
    |-----------|------|
    | Pigeon    | 1837 |
    | Peacock   | 1821 |
    | Toucan    | 1758 |
    | Parrot    | 1824 |
    | Swan      | 1758 |

* [ ] **Fish:**

    | Name      | Year Named |
    |-----------|------|
    | Salmon    | 1758 |
    | Catfish   | 1817 |
    | Perch     | 1758 |

* Using Lambda Expressions and displaying the results to the console
  * [ ] List all the animals in descending order by year named
  * [ ] List all the animals alphabetically
  * [ ] List all the animals order by how they move
  * [ ] List only those animals the breath with lungs
  * [ ] List only those animals that breath with lungs and were named in 1758
  * [ ] List only those animals that lay eggs and breath with lungs
  * [ ] List alphabetically only those animals that were named in 1758

* Stretch Goal
  * [ ] For the list of animals, list alphabetically those animals that are mammals.
